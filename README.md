# Simulating Protoplanetary Disks Using Monte Carlo Techniques (POLARIS)  
**[A CAU Internship Report]**

This repository contains the report and associated files from my internship at Kiel University (CAU), where I worked on simulating protoplanetary disks using Monte Carlo techniques with the POLARIS code.

## Abstract

We aim to simulate the appearance of a passively heated protoplanetary disk with a specified density distribution, using two different dust mixtures: one with water ice and one without. By employing Monte Carlo photon transfer techniques, we calculate dust heating through absorption, emission, and scattering processes. We compare the resulting images to develop a method for observing and distinguishing the presence and spatial distribution of water ice in protoplanetary disks.
